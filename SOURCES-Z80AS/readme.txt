This folder contains the source files, ready to be assembled ONLY using Z80AS ( https://github.com/Laci1953/Z80AS )

The code is identical with the code from SOURCES, only some directives were changed.

The RTSYS.AS is a merge of the following files from SOURCES: RTSYS1A.AS, RTSYS1B.AS, RTSYS2A.AS, RTSYS2B.AS

Overall, readability is improved (notice the use of IF,THEN,ENDIF directives)
